# Cardinal fruit

Took a bite from the apple. <br>
Stood aside and I tremble.

Lookalike to resemble. <br>
Lost a fight in this battle.

Not alright, but I handle. <br>
Glooming light like a candle.

Losing sight of my ettle. <br>
Chosing places to settle.

Looming night forthright mettle, <br>
Putting down the snake's rattle.
