# Dire straits

Hike into the woods. <br>
Find virtuous goods.

Lost my mind, many times. <br>
Crossed thy line, crazy eyes.

Lost and found in there. <br>
God's around thin air.

Almost died, my network fried. <br>
All those lies, thy angels cried.

Back to life, back to light. <br>
Back to life, back to fight.
