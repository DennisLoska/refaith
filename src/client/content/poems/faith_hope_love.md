# Faith, Hope, Love

I believe that the Lord sacrificed his life for me because I also sacrifice my life.

I hope that the Lord gives me the strength to carry my own cross to the end because I do not let go of it.

I love because I carry my cross and do not love my own life nor the world.

**1 Corinthians 13:13 But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.**
