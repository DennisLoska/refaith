# Molochy

Social media like monopoly<br>
Unhealthy competition is so molochy<br>
Matter is what matters, that is my philosophy<br>
All lived experience - phenomenology

Chase the beauty no matter the cost<br>
Pass the victims, compassion is lost<br>
Snapchat dysmorphia -<br>
Will you ever regret that dystopia?

Shaping, rounding, molding, holding<br>
all what's shown is soul-destroying<br>
Cast away your morals towards<br>
Incense burning Moloch's altars

Competition it's a race<br>
Apply filter's on your face<br>
Escalate the beauty wars<br>
Swallowed up at crashing shores

Monetize and don't distinguish<br>
Due to fear of missed influence<br>
Will you ever cherrish the fruits of honesty?<br>
Will you hold them up high in terms of modesty?

**1. Timothy 2:9**

_9 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; 10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works._

**1. Peter 3:3**

_3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; 4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price._
