# Run

I got mosquito stings, down my legs <br>
And I'm running fast on these tracks

Put my focus on my elevated pace <br>
And my heart rate, mate - it's a champions race

Run run run - breathin' and out <br>
Under the sun, life's rushing through the body now

Beware be prepared, momentary chase <br>
Cameras on don't make an angry face

I want to win the prize, that's how I race <br>
I give it all I have, making time and space

The winner takes it all, the loser standing small <br>
To become successful, you just gotta beat em all

Run run run breathin' and out <br>
Under the sun, life's rushing through the body now

Step by step, I'm in a perfect condition <br>
Breathing in, breathing out during this competition
