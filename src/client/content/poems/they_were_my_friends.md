# They were my friends

You can eat them, remember. <br>
Only because of their character.

Remember the water buffalos, right? <br>
They did not kill you in moonlight.

Found friends with a crow. <br>
Don't eat that one, though.

Because sometimes he is not nice. <br>
and too much intelligence pays the price.

"They were my friends" <br>
Payed for the slaughter.

"They were my friends" <br>
He said joyful in laughter.
