# Uncanny valley

Chased by thoughts. <br>
Haunted by dogs.

Not one resting place, <br>
in this empty space.

Captured by my melting face. <br>
Fractured, missing saving grace.

When I got out, it dawned upon me. <br>
This life I had, was not lived for thee.

This life is not for me. <br>
I'm your uncanny valley.
